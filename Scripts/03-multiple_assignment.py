#you may be wondering
#does python have constants ?
#No it does not.
#Python pretty much assumes the programmer knows what they are doing
#and it will let you do anything you want. It relies on naming
# conventions instead.
# So if you want something to be a constant, put it in all caps
# and then just treat it as a constant
MY_CONSTANT = 1000

# Python in general relies a lot on conventions and people writing "Pythonic" code.
